scrambla is a smb2/3 server written in python.
It is limited in scope but is complete enough to be useful for error injection
and testing clients.

The biggest missing features at this point is
* It does not fork a connection and only accests a single client connection.
  Once the client disconnects the server will terminate.
  
* It is read-only
* it does not verify the ntlmssp auth packet and simply allows everyone in as
  guest.
* is does not track uids/gids of the client and all i/o will be performed as
  root.

That said, it is complete enough to mount -o ro from a linux client,
list directories, stat files and read files.

Add more text once the server gains more features.

Configuration
=============
Configuration is done in server/config.py.
See server/config.py.example for an example configuration file.

To run it
=========
sudo PYTHONPATH=`pwd` python ./server/main.py

Directory structure
===================
smb2/ : This directory contains the mappings between bytearrays and dicts
        for the smb2/3 protocol.
	This mapping is supported for both encoding and decoding of all the
	objects and can be used to build both a client as well a server.
server/ : This directory contains the code to run a simple server.
tests/  : Test-suite to validate the marshalling/unmarshalling of the
          smb2/ code.
